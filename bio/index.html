          Born in the shimmering City of Angels, <flex class="large-text">Pasha Nathaniel Missaghieh</flex> is a musician 
          whose passion and expression knows no bounds, and thirst for greatness is unquenchable. 
          Of Persian-Jewish descent, Pasha’s family migrated from Iran right prior to the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the age of 3, Pasha had developed an incredible love for rhythm, latching onto a 
          song’s beat and never letting go. He began formally playing the drums at age 12 after 
          a friend of his had also began playing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After feeling discouraged at first like many beginners and putting down the sticks, 
          he relearned two years later by listening to songs deeply and dissecting their drum 
          parts by ear. This led Pasha to become very inspired by different drummers, allowing 
          him to learn from virtually any drummer, merely through listening. At age 16, Pasha decided 
          to take up music professionally, playing in local bands, his high school jazz ensemble, as 
          well as teaching drums to younger students. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon graduating high school, Pasha enrolled in Musicians Institute Hollywood to earn his 
          Associate of Arts in Drum Performance (emphasis in Music Business). He became infatuated 
          with new music discoveries in jazz such as Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock, Cortex, Jaco Pastorius, 
          Steve Gadd, and Harvey Mason. This caused Pasha to take his drumming to a more improvisational and 
          rhythmically expressive direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not long after, Pasha joined Los Angeles artists Sabrina Cyan and Josh Rogan on the stage. 
          Bringing an aspect of comfort, excitement, expression, and relaxation, Sabrina’s Adele-esque 
          sound quickly hovered over the folk-rock-fusion genre, while also tapping into dance grooves, 
          similarly with Josh only more Southern. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pasha lives to create rhythm, express feeling through sound, and to infect people with his drum grooves.
